Reached mid-semester point, with quite a few new lectures to prepare. Nothing extremely complicated but, as always, the tricky part is finding a way to make it meaningful and memorable. Sometimes, and this is one of those times, I sound like a broken record but I’m a bit obsessive about helping people to ‘get’ a topic.

- I gave [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) a go while preparing model answers for an assignment. I liked the integration with RStudio and the possibility of using several markup languages. For simple documents Markdown + R is an excellent combination to generate HTML output. However, I wanted to generate PDF output with some math, so I went for latex integration. [Jeromy Anglim’s](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com) site provides a very good starting point for using knitr to document reproducible analyses.
- Simply statistics on [Statistics/Statisticians need better marketing](https://web.archive.org/web/20121016003025/http://simplystatistics.org/post/29407938554/statistics-statisticians-need-better-marketing).
- [France in the year 2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20121003071408/https://publicdomainreview.org/2012/06/30/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/): a series of futuristic pictures by Jean-Marc Côté and other artists issued in France in 1899, 1900, 1901 and 1910.
- Forty five [self-portraits](http://thechive.com/2012/08/09/self-portraits-done-to-a-different-drug-every-day-45-photos/) under different psychoactive drugs.
- David Smith]: “SAS still fighting the open-source wars from last decade” when [recurring to FUD](https://web.archive.org/web/20130201182042/https://www.allanalytics.com/author.asp?section_id=1408&doc_id=249105).
