Before I forget: a few links about starting up in Python for scientific projects:

- Basic Data Analysis and More—A Guided Tour Using python. PDF in the [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.6002.pdf).
- [Python Scientific Lecture Notes](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/). Quick introduction chapters.
- [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python!](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) An opinionated intro to Python.
- [Numba versus Cython](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/24/numba-vs-cython/), for when you really need speed.

Now if we had a great Python library for linear mixed models life would be easier.
