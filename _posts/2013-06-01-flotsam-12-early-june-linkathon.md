A list of interesting R/Stats quickies to keep the mind distracted:

- A long draft [Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/) by Cosma Shalizi, in which he uses R to drive home the message. Not your average elementary point of view.
- [Good notes](http://davenportspatialanalytics.squarespace.com/blog/2012/6/19/notes-from-a-recent-spatial-r-class-i-gave.html) by Frank Davenport on starting using R with data from a Geographic Information System (GIS). Read this so you get a general idea of how things fit together.
- If you are in to maps, [Omnia sunt Communia!](http://procomun.wordpress.com/) provides many good tips on producing them using R.
- If you are in to data/learning visualization you have to watch Bret Victor’s presentation on [Media for thinking the unthinkable](http://vimeo.com/67076984). He is so far ahead what we normally do that it is embarrassing.
- I follow mathematician [Atabey Kaygun](https://twitter.com/Atabey_Kaygun) in twitter and since yesterday I’ve been avidly reading his coverage of the protests in Turkey. Surely there are more important things going on in the world than the latest R gossip.

I’m marking too many assignments right now to have enough time to write something more substantial. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel though.
