Man flu kept me at home today, so I decided to do something ‘useful’ and go for a linkathon:

- Ed Yong discusses the effect of subject expectations in psychology experiments "Nice Results, But What Did You Expect?" (National Geographic article vanished). At the beginning there was another article on [The placebo phenomenon](http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/01/the-placebo-phenomenon).
- A [googleVis tutorial](http://decastillo.github.io/googleVis_Tutorial/) to create Hans Rosling-type graphs from R.
- [Google’s Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) is material for an intensive 2-day course on Python.
- An opinion piece on [Calculus and statistics](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2013/07/01/calculus-and-statistics/) by Daniel Kaplan, on teaching a different version of your typical introductory calculus course, so it is useful for statistics. He goes as far as teaching calculus using R. There is more information in [Project MOSAIC](http://mosaic-web.org/).
- Nice graphs on [what happened to Asiana Airlines flight 214](http://flyingprofessors.net/what-happened-to-asiana-airlines-flight-214-2/). I didn’t know there was so much available data for a specific flight.
- [Biased and Inefficient](https://notstatschat.netlify.com/), Thomas Lumley’s personal statistics blog (he insists that posting 75% of Statschat is not enough to qualify as personal). You may know Thomas from the survey package (or a few others).
- If you are a postgrad student in New Zealand you can apply for a NeSI (New Zealand eScience Infrastructure) [postgraduate allocation](https://www.nesi.org.nz/news/green-light-postgraduates-nesi-supercomputers) to access high performance computing facilities.
- My previous post [the USA versus Western Europe comparison of GM corn](/2013/07/my-take-on-the-usa-versus-western-europe-comparison-of-gm-corn/) was the first time that I received more traffic from Facebook than from R-bloggers. Five hundred readers in total.

Over and out.
