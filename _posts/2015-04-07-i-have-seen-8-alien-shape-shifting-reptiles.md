Some months ago I supported a [PledgeMe campaign](https://www.pledgeme.co.nz/projects/2544-getting-the-conspiracy-theory-theorist-to-miami) to get Matthew Dentith, who has a PhD in conspiracy theories, to a conference in Miami. Today I received a postcard that made my day; it started as “I have seen 8 alien shape-shifting reptiles…”

Nice to see that Matthew is enjoying the US’s conspiratorial environment.
