This year requires an extra dose of new perspective, to make the most of time, to bring the best of people.

> Whenever humanity seems condemned to heaviness, I think I should fly like Perseus into a different space. I donâ€™t mean escaping into dreams or the irrational. I mean that I have to change my approach, look at the world from a different perspective, with a different logic and with fresh methods of cognition and verification.
