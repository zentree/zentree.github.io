In Mac OS I was getting an annoying warning when compiling Cpp code via Rcpp in R:

```
ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/usr/local/gfortran/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin15/version_number'
```

Adding a file called `Makevars` in `~/.R` defining `FLIBS` to the actual location of gfortran in my machine fixed the problem. In my case, `Makevars` only contains the following line:

```
FLIBS=-L/usr/local/gfortran/lib
```

Thatâ€™s it.
