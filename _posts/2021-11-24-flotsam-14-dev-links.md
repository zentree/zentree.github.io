Back doing some coding, playing with R packages and collaborating with someone else. This is an unusual situation for me, as I write my own code, and never bothered learning to use git (or other code management system). With the help of the Twitter crowd Iâ€™ve been slowly learning to use some git so the first link goes to [How to Rebase a Pull Request](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request).

Another interesting link is [Getting started with unit testing in R](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2021-11-23-getting-started-with-unit-testing-in-r/), which will come handy with some other programming work implementing research models.
