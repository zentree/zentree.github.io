Before I lose the link—as I’m deleting toots &amp; tweets two weeks after I post the—I should save the address for “[Introduction to Modern Causal Inference](https://alejandroschuler.github.io/mci/)” by Alejandro Schuler and Mark van der Laan. It is a book draft that looks quite readable.

Also love Xanthe Tynehorne, Esq.’s [Compendium of Curious Words](https://satyrs.eu/words/). Weird enough to make it interesting.

Count me fascinated by the [Literature Clock](https://literature-clock.jenevoldsen.com/) by [Johs Enevoldsen](https://twitter.com/JohsEnevoldsen), which presents a text from a novel, poem, etc with the time of your computer clock.

I have kept on adding links until 5th February:

This [Bayesian Data Analysis](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/gsu2023.html) course, by [Aki Vehtari](http://@avehtari@bayes.club), based on the classic [BDA3 book](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/BDA3.pdf) (link to the free online version) looks really interesting. Even more so if you already have done some Bayesian stats work/study before.

[Against Copyediting: Is It Time to Abolish the Department of Corrections?](https://lithub.com/against-copyediting-is-it-time-to-abolish-the-department-of-corrections/) by Helen Rubinstein got me thinking about how we “correct” while editing texts, in my case mostly writings by postgrad students.
