Adrian Kosmaczewski has an interesting post on [How to write a programming book](https://akos.ma/blog/how-to-write-a-programming-book/) (using ASCIIDOC of all things). And another one on [Joplin for notetaking](https://akos.ma/blog/joplin-for-note-taking/). I feel we are looking for similar things, dealing with a crossplatform environment. I’m walking just a few years behind him.

Tim Harford: [Cautionary Tales – Office Hell: The demise of the playful workspace](https://timharford.com/2023/03/cautionary-tales-office-hell-the-demise-of-the-playful-workspace/) (38 minutes podcast). On the failure to control work environment for knowledge workers which, of course, includes writing.

[Academic Muse](https://academicmuse.org/), a site about academic writing.

[Get a Life, PhD](http://getalifephd.blogspot.com/) another site about academic writing.
