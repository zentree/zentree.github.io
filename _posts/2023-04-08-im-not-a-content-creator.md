I struggle with the word “content”—as used in “content creator” or “content producer”—to refer to creative endeavours. Content as something included or contained into a blank space. Content as fungible filler, writing, sounds, images that can be easily (unnoticeably) replaced with something else.

“Content” diminishes creation. As an amateur I create writings, pictures, code and sounds for the sake of it, because I love (*amare*) doing it. Likely it is not at the same level as a professional who does it for a living, but these activities are a part of me.

“Content” reduces creation to units of commercial exchange, which are the opposite of why I, and probably many people, spend time creating and sharing what I do.

I’m a creator, but not of content, and I share my creations for free.
