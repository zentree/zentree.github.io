These days I deal mostly with quantitative genetics and wood properties. However, trees are much more than wood and one of our PhD students at the School of Forestry, [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/schools/forestry/) had a look at production of Eucalypts essential oils, particularly cineole.  
  
One can easily see the seasonality of production (peak in Spring &amp; Summer) and the difference between juvenile and mature foliage. Details available at:
