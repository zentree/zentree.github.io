In the [previous post](/2023/10/12/early-selection-how-early-is-early-enough-part-1/) I mentioned that we wanted to screen trees for wood properties as early as possible, BUT there is a lot of “noise” with the mix of normal and reaction wood (compression in softwoods or tension in hardwoods). The main problems for running a glasshouse experiment were:

- How to separate normal and reaction wood? Here the good-old-leaning-trees approach was handy.
- Trees move a lot in real life, what’s the effect of thigmomorphogenesis (fancy name for response to movement)? How can we move them? Build a rocking machine: having good technicians help.
- How good are the screening methods? Before embarking in a big experiment, better look first in a few clones with contrasting wood properties (4 Arborgen varieties). If that doesn’t work, pull the plug.

So we got a glasshouse with four clones, some ramets standing, some leaning and some rocking for eight months ([video here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/8g0h9kyjpKA)). Standing trees and rocking trees had random arcs of compression wood, but rocking reduced wood stiffness by 20%, which is similar to what happens to mature trees on the edge of stands. Leaning trees nicely separated normal and compression wood, which now could be analyzed separately; not only that, but they magnified the differences between the clones. TO BE CONTINUED.
