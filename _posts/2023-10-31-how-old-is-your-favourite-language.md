We often forget for how long weâ€™ve been writing code in specific languages. For example, I started using SAS in 1992 for the analysis of progeny trials, Python to control Fortran sampling simulations in 1997, and R for general statistics in 1998. Your favourite language could be fairly old:  
  
Fortran: 66 years old  
COBOL: 64 yo  
Lisp: 63 yo  
BASIC: 59 yo  
C: 51 yo  
SAS: 51 yo  
SQL: 49 yo  
MATLAB: 44 yo  
C++: 38 yo  
Python: 32 yo  
R: 30 yo  
Java: 28 yo  
Ruby: 28 yo  
Javascript: 27 yo  
Clojure: 16 yo  
Julia: 11 yo  
Elixir: 11 years old
