A month ago I said “trees are much more than wood and one of our PhD students at the School of Forestry, [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz) had a look at production of Eucalypts essential oils, particularly cineole”. We could easily see seasonality of production (peak in Spring &amp; Summer) and the difference between juvenile and mature foliage. ([Eucalypts essential oil](/2023/10/10/eucalypts-essential-oils/))  
  
Today, fresh from the oven, we have our new article moving from phenotypic variability to the genetic control of 20 essential-oil compounds with exciting names like 1,8-cineole and aromadendrene. A tale of alternative species and products, progeny trials and gas chromatography.  
  
Of the 85 tested *E. bosistoana* families, seven families possessed breeding values indicating that their oil would meet the British Pharmacopoeia standard specification of a minimum of 70% 1,8-cineole. However, the negative correlation between total oil content and 1,8-cineole concentration indicates that families with higher-quality oil have less oil in their leaves.
