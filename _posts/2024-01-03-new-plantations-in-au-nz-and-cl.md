Looking at new forest plantations areas in Chile (data from INFOR), Australia (ABARES) and New Zealand (MPI) since 1994, as the Chilean dataset starts then.  
  
Interesting to see how the expansion of the forest estate collapsed in all three Southern Hemisphere countries at the start of the 2010s. Lately, New Zealand has seen an increase mostly due to market for Carbon Sequestration.  
  
Why did I choose those three countries? I have worked in all of them and all three use radiata pine (although new plantings may involve *Eucalyptus* as well).
