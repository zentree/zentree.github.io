The last 2 months or so I have been revisiting the Chilean forest sector and mentally comparing values with other two places: Australia (where I worked 6 years) and New Zealand (where Iâ€™ve been living for close to two decades). Previous related posts [here](/2024/01/03/new-plantations-in-au-nz-and-cl/) and [here](/2024/01/13/we-all-stopped-expanding-our-forest-estate/).  
  
We often get stuck considering specific values of dynamic systems instead of the overall trends; a bit like worrying about a specific frame instead of the whole movie.  
  
New Zealand radiata pine has been remarkable stable: around 89% of the planted forest estate area for a long time and with a fairly low percentage of eucalypts (under 2%). In contrast, Australia and Chile have experienced large changes on the percentage of eucalypts (mostly *Eucalyptus globulus* and *E. nitens*) versus radiata pine during the last 20 years. In Chile this change has been accompanied by capital investment in processing facilities.  
  
At the same time, the Chilean curves hide a fundamental change during the last 10 years.
