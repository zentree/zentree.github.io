> While \[Active Papers\] has achieved its mission of demonstrating that unifying computational reproducibility and provenance tracking is doable and useful, it has also demonstrated that Python is not a suitable platform to build on for reproducible research. Breaking changes at all layers of the software stack are too frequent.

I started using Python for my PhD around 1997, to control simulations I wrote using Fortran 90. I chose Python based on [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABqMbcBa0MC8wZwucnyydSpW4ES0yurQp0)[Konrad Hinsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konrad-hinsen-61b3b72/)â€™s writings at the time in a long-disappeared website. A few years later I moved all my work to R, which I found much more stable. I have some 20-year-old R base code that still runs. ðŸ˜‡  
  
Incidentally, last year I wrote a series of posts on [Some love for base R](/2023/03/18/some-love-for-base-r-part-1/).
