[Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net)â€™s [My McLuhan lecture on enshittification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nycso_OQes0). How we got to the current dystopia and how we can fix it. We need more competition, more regulation, more self-help, and more empowered workers.  
  
This applies to any industry; yes, even to your niche job, and to mine.
