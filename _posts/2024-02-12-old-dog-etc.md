Yesterday I attended an introduction to “Artificial Intelligence in Forestry”\* workshop at the School of Forestry, [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz). There were plenty of industry people, including some of I taught “a few” years ago.  
  
I am mostly a quantitative genetics/stats person, but I keep my eyes open for anything that could be helpful dealing with my genetics trials, and have dabbled on using spatial things, LiDAR, etc. As I have pointed out in the past: 1. I am a sucker for entertaining problems and 2. old dogs can learn, albeit more slowly than 30 years ago, new tricks.  
  
It was a nice opportunity to dip my toes in applications of machine learning for image analysis (detection and classification), mostly using ArcGis Pro and a short exercise using R. Funnily enough, my biggest barrier in the workshop was dealing with Windows + ArcGis. I am a Mac and Linux person, generally dealing with coding statistical analyses writing commands in text files. Most of my GIS related work is done via R (which I’ve been using since 1997) and any interactive work with maps using QGIS. Finding anything with point and click took me ages, until we got to the R part, which was hard for most people but kind of easy for yours truly.  
  
Most importantly, having a chat with people and getting ideas to try with my data were the coolest part of the day. Thanks to [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABCzwWYBzgPbNZaGROIMIE6R743DWSTxxLI)Vega Xu, Justing Morgenroth and Ning Ye for organising the course!  
  
\*Confession: I dislike attaching the AI label to everything these days. Perhaps a better name would have been “Machine Learning in Forestry”. Small detail.
