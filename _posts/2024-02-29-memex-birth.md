I am all the time reading and taking notes in bits and pieces of paper, that inevitably I lose. They are too small to include in my main blog. So I just created the Aleph (thinking of Jorge Luis Borges’ story) as a [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex): as an open Borgesian memex. Get it?

Inspiration to do this: Cory Doctorow’s Pluralistic ([explained](https://craphound.com/news/2021/05/23/the-memex-method/) in his podcast) and Warren Ellis’ [Writer’s Notebook](https://warrenellis.ltd).
