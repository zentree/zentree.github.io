I have been using internet since 1993, which means thousands of browsed sites, broken links, storing and losing information for over three decades. One obvious point of the exercise is that every time I have relied on someone else’s system I have ended up losing lots of information.

Delicio.us, Twitter, etc. have consumed my data and time without an ability to maintain a good archive of my information. The only data that has remained is the one I have personally stored under my own system/payment. I have been a slow learner in this respect, so I have started another section of this site, [Aleph](/aleph/), just to store bits and pieces of information I am collecting while browsing.

The [first post](/2024/02/29/memex-birth/) in Aleph briefly documents the rationale; actually it just links to Cory Doctorow’s post to that effect.
