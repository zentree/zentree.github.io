There was a time, roughly 30 years ago, when my whole career extended to an unknown, distant future. What should I do? Where should I be working? were the questions in my mind during a hot Chilean summer. At that time, New Zealand and Australia were not in the horizon and I had just applied to my first forestry job in Valdivia.

I got that job and three years later I started my PhD. I met people, travelled, gained citizenships, made friends, learned many things, forgot others. Today, thirty years after that summer, I look to the next 10 years in the future and ask myself: What should I do? Where should I be working? The same questions plus What would be the best use of my time?

Now that distant unknown is three decades closer. Should I do more administration and, strange misnomer, “service” to the profession? (as if all the other work was not of service). Should I go for a new push of research work, write up all the ideas thought but not completed and published? Maybe I should transfer all I know to other people.

All of the above, a mix of two, one only… What would be the best use of my time?
