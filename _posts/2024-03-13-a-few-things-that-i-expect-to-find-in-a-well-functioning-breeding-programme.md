A good understanding of the biological traits that have an effect on profit. Can we identify new, more efficient selection criteria?

A clear awareness of trade-offs between: traits, genetic evaluation options, deployment systems, etc. Trade-offs are everywhere in breeding programmes.

A database system that contains all the data.

A well-documented genetic evaluation system: we can rerun the evaluation and get exactly the same results. The system can be developed in-house or can use commercial software (like asreml, SAS, Bolt, etc) but the code must be available.

Reproductive biology: essential to sort out the best deployment.

Figured/figuring out what are the main environmental drivers affecting performance. It is easy for some species, very difficult for others.

Personnel continuity BUT the programme can survive the proverbial bus running over the breeder.
