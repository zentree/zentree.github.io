Most of my followers are English speakers (native speakers, second-language, third-language, nth-language speakers) so they could be confused by my occasional posts in Spanish. Well, I was born in Chile and grew up in Chile, Venezuela and Argentina so it shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise that I have professional interests in Latin America. I care deeply about forestry and breeding as professional activities and have opinions, some would say too many opinions üòâ, about improving the way we do things.  
  
We should question the status quo, because ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù sometimes it is just ‚Äúmeh practice‚Äù. We need kaizen, continuous improvement, but we also need to reevaluate what we are doing and how we are doing it: discontinuous improvement (kaikaku). Obviously I also happen to have too many opinions about how forestry, and in particular forestry subsidies, should run in Chile, therefore, you patient reader get posts in Spanish.  
  
As you might guess, some of the opinions will not win popularity contests but they are part of my ‚Äúcritic and conscience of society‚Äù academic role. I also have an interest in history and contexts, which might help to explain some of my comments.  
  
Discussing some issues in forestry feels like riding a bicycle in tree canopies.
