The short answer: because the trait you like is not part of the breeding objective and, therefore, has not an economic weight assigned to it. And if it doesn’t have an economic weight it has 0 (zero) economic importance.

A longer answer: in breeding there is a distinction between objective traits (which have an impact on profit), and the selection criteria (variables that are easy and cheap to assess, and that are correlated with the objective traits). They may even happen at different ages. For example, in forestry stem volume and wood stiffness at rotation age (say 25 years) can be objective traits for the production of structural timber. Stem diameter, wood density and standing tree velocity at age 8 can be selection criteria.

Some of the confusion may come from when people like a selection criterion (like wood density) and think the breeding programme is trying to improve that. In this example, we weren’t (at least at that time). We cared about volume and stiffness. Sacrificing levels of some selection criterion while pursuing the objective traits is perfectly fine if I am maximising value. And in a modern breeding programme you are pretty much always looking at value, not at a single trait.
