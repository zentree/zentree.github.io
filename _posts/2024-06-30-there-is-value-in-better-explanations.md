I am often fascinated by people who can explain something that I already know but in a *much better* way. For example, Howie Hua is great at looking at mathematical issues ([geometric mean, in this example](https://www.tiktok.com/@howie_hua/video/7386109438152805663)) and coming up with a simple, straightforward way of presenting it; a way that feels fresh.

If we can explain things (here is my attempt at “changes of rankings”), if we can socialise, if we can share a common understanding with colleagues, customers, community; then we can do a much better job in our projects. This is true in forestry, breeding and, I guess, pretty much any activity.
