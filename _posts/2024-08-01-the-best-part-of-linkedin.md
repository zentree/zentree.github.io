After “professional Twitter’s” demise I joined LinkedIn (less than a year ago) to keep in touch with colleagues. Overall, I like the posts from people I chose to follow and dislike most of the “suggested by the algorithm” motivational, HR, marketing, leadership, etc. posts.  
  
However, the best part, at least for me, is to see updates by our Forestry students. Looking at their new jobs, either in New Zealand or very far away. Pictures in the office, dealing with tree establishment, forest fires, forest management, processing, etc. It makes me happy to feel even tangentially connected to their new experiences outside the university. Cheers to all of them.
