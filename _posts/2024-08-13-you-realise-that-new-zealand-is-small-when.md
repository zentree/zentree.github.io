I was chatting with a colleague ([](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAQD9ocB8_WxB6eMq7sw7VMafiRmqm1AHVA)[Salvador Gezan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvador-gezan-54768a1a/)) in April about teaching, learning and books, and he suggested “have a look at Rex Bernardo’s book”. I searched for it in my university library, no luck. I thought “well, just ask for it as an interlibrary loan. Surely we can borrow a copy from another university in the country and get it in a few days”.  
  
I forgot all about the interloan for three months (!), when I received an email from my university library, saying something like “Hey, we couldn’t find the book you were looking for in NZ. However, we ordered a copy for you”. Then another email today, “Hey, please come and pick up your book from the central library”.  
  
And here I am, at the library with THE copy of the book. We are that small in NZ.  
  
P.S. Salvador and I both did our undergrad at the Universidad de Chile, just with a few years difference.
