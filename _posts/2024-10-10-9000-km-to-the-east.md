The end (of the semester) is nigh, involving the typical drama of assignments, grades, etc. On top of that, Duncan McLean (one of our PhD students) successfully defended his thesis, which now means including a few suggested changes so he can be formally called Dr McLean. And working with Juan Carlos Valverde (a visiting PhD student from Universidad de Concepci√≥n), plus preparing a presentation for the [IX Chilean Congress of Forest Sciences](https://www.ixcongresoforestal.cl/), this October in Valdivia, which happens to be roughly 9,000 km to the East.  
  
The presentation introduces a paper that we are writing with my colleague Clemens Altaner, looking at the genetic control of pith-to-bark stiffness trajectories.
