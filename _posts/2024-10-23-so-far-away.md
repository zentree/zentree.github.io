During the last two weeks I have been travelling in Chile, talking and listening (a lot) about forestry in general, but also politics, given that local/regional elections are happening this weekend.

I rarely show up in photos in my posts (unlike marketing people üòõ) but today is an exception. My first job after university was at the Chilean Tree Improvement Cooperative in Valdivia, Southern Chile. Thirty one (!) years later I am attending the IX Congress of the Chilean Society of Forest Sciences in Valdivia. Meeting old friends and colleagues and enjoying watching the work presented by the new crop of researchers and postgrad students.

Sometimes people ask me ‚ÄúWhy do you go to that congress?‚Äù meaning instead of going to the US or Europe. Weeeelll, one part is that many of the species and type of forests are similar between Chile and New Zealand. Another reason is that the Congress includes a very broad set of topics (ecology, silviculture, wood science, etc). And I get to see family and friends. Finally, I enjoy going to ‚Äúpicadas‚Äù cheap restaurants that sell traditional foods. I don‚Äôt care about fancy restaurants selling food that you can buy anywhere else in the world, but going to a picada, I‚Äôm in!
