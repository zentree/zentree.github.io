Let’s set the bar at the right level: I am not having a child or moving countries. I confess that I didn’t win the lottery either. What did happen is that last June I applied for academic promotion, to progress from Associate Professor to Professor, and I was informed that my application was successful. Yay!

I will have to inform my students that instead of calling me Luis, as they do now, they should call me Luis, to mark the difference.

I would like to thank everyone who has supported my work over the years, including family, friends, colleagues and collaborators. A particular mention to my referees (Fikret, Keith, Lauri, Matti, Mike &amp; Rowly), who assisted with their time and writing on my application.
