“Who gets to have an opinion on the hīkoi and who must remain ‘impartial’?”  
  
I enjoyed reading Madelaine Chapman’s column on [who gets to play the impartial card](https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/19-11-2024/who-gets-to-have-an-opinion-on-the-hikoi-and-who-must-remain-impartial). The Treaty Principles Bill, which inspired that column, does not start from a neutral place, but ignores a lot of history since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.

I liked this photo of New Zealand Historian Vincent O’Malley with a sign saying “Read some bloody history”; bloody it is.

I write mostly technical posts, but my work does not exist in a vacuum, so it is time for some #nzpol .
