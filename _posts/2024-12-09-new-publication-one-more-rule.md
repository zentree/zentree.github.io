This week we got an article published in New Forests on phenotyping radiata pine for resin. This is part of the work on very early screening (at age 2 years) of populations for wood properties:

Altaner CM, Gordon AJ, Sharma M and Apiolaza LA. 2024. Phenotyping a *Pinus radiata* breeding population for resin canal traits. New Forests 56: 18 DOI: [10.1007/s11056-024-10087-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11056-024-10087-1) ([PDF](/assets/pdf/altaner_et_al_2024_phenotyping_resin.pdf)).

Some time ago, I wrote about [burning money](/2024/04/04/taylor-francis-made-me-do-it/) with our Read and Publish open access agreements. I mentioned that we have a quota of articles, first-in, first-served, that are published open access "for free". Outside this quota, the article is not open access, which is what happened with this article: it was accepted too late in the year. Now we have to add one more rule to our submissions: get the manuscripts accepted, with revisions, before October.

If you want to read the article, have a look in my website under [publications](/publications).
