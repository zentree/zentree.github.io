Some Profs at uni say that we should teach students how to use LLMs (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc) ethically and responsibly. But how can we do that with tools that, at their core, are

1. based on stealing labor from creators,
2. catastrophic from an environmental point of view due to its high energy consumption, and
3. burning billions of dollars on speculative investment, to
4. produce little value?
